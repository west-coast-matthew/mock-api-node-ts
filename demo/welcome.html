            This is a vanilla HTML/Javascript demo for consuming the mock APIs in the project. 
       </p>

       <p>
            By default, each API accepts an optional argument which forces the server to 
            emulate a delayed response. The purpose here is to emulate long response times in order 
            to fine tune progress indicators from a UI perspective. 
       </p>

       <p>
            For demonstration purposes, each call will pass in the optional delay argument with an random value.
